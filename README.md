# SilverLeague

SilverLeague is a collaborative, community driven group of [SilverStripe](https://www.silverstripe.org) developers who band together to produce, improve and maintain a set of high quality SilverStripe modules.

## Why?

Most SilverStripe modules are open source. Many are owned and/or maintained by individual community developers. While this is great, sometimes it's just better to work in a team.

SilverLeague aims to create a community of active SilverStripe developers who collaboratively create, maintain, review and improve a set of approved SilverLeague modules. Much like [The League of Extraordinary Packages](https://thephpleague.com/), we aim to conform to various best-practice standards.

## Modules

# Contributing

We'd love you to contribute! We do have a couple of processes to follow though depending on the "phase" of the module you're using:

**Draft phase:** Please submit pull requests to the appropriate module "specification" file and indicate your suggested changes. Feel free to review other requests too. Requests will be merged by a SilverLeague community member once approved.

**Development and active support phase:** Ideas, proposals and contributions are readily accepted in the form of issues or pull requests on the appropriate SilverLeague repository.

## Versioning

All SilverLeague modules will adhere to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).
