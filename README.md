# SilverLeague

SilverLeague is a collaborative, community driven group of [SilverStripe](https://www.silverstripe.org) developers who band together to produce, improve and maintain a set of high quality SilverStripe modules.

## Why?

Most SilverStripe modules are open source. Many are owned and/or maintained by individual community developers. While this is great, sometimes it's just better to work in a team.

SilverLeague aims to create a community of active SilverStripe developers who collaboratively create, maintain, review and improve a set of approved SilverLeague modules. Much like [The League of Extraordinary Packages](https://thephpleague.com/), we aim to conform to various best-practice standards.
