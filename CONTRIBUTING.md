# Contributing

We'd love you to contribute! We do have a couple of processes to follow though depending on the "phase" of the module you're using:

**Draft phase:** Please submit pull requests to the appropriate module "specification" file and indicate your suggested changes. Feel free to review other requests too. Requests will be merged by a SilverLeague community member once approved.

**Development and active support phase:** Ideas, proposals and contributions are readily accepted in the form of issues or pull requests on the appropriate SilverLeague repository.
